          I am a twenty two year old aspiring professional. I currently study Human Development Studies and aim to work with young adults in a leadership capacity.
            <br> I am the oldest in my family as well as being a first generation college student and I take pride in setting a good example. As a hobby I do
            <br> studio and outdoor modeling and often design the creative concept of the photoshoot. Aside from working as a Community Health Advocate with Lifespan, 
            <br> I also enjoy driving for uber and meeting new people that way. My favorite things to do on my free time are to explore nature, shop and try new food places. 
            <br> My favorite foods can be found in mexican and italian cousine and I am huge fan of seafoods. I consider myself to be adventourous, passionate and foward
            <br> thinking. Thank you for taking the time to get to know about me.
